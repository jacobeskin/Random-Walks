Excercise 1 problem 2

Compilation: make -f makeMCE1P2
Running: ./Ex1P02.exe a b, where a and b are values for l_1 and l_2

Used 10000 walkers with 1000 steps. Did the run with l_1=1 and l_2=2, l_1=2 
and l_2=3 and l_1=1 with l_2=4, and the results for <R²> where 2517.782, 
6567.75 and 8484.511 respectively. Code prints out a text file of how <R²> 
changes with N. Relation between <R²> and number of steps was linear, as can be seen from the two pictures. 

Walkers direction on every step is determined by an angle randomly generated.
